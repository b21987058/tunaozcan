Project Overview

This project involves a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch for classifying images from the Animals-10 dataset. 
The CNN model features multiple layers including convolutional, ReLU activations, max pooling, and fully connected layers.

Functionality and Customization

Key functions include train_and_validate for running the training sessions, and evaluate for assessing the model's performance. 
The model's architecture and hyperparameters can be adjusted to explore different setups and their effects on performance. 
Ensure that dependencies such as PyTorch, NumPy, and Matplotlib are installed before beginning.
